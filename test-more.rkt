;;======================================================================
;;    The racket testing module has a few things I wish it did differently:
;;
;; 1) The test function names are verbose and redundant.  check-this, check-that, etc
;;
;; 2) The test functions display nothing on success.  There's no way
;; to tell the difference between "no tests ran" and "all tests
;; succeeded"
;;
;; 3) The tests return nothing.  You can't do conditional tests like:
;;        (unless (is os 'Windows) (ok test-that-won't-pass-on-windows))
;;
;;
;; This module addresses those problems.  It's named for, and largely a
;; clone of, the Test::More library on Perl's CPAN, although some
;; of the Perl version's features are not implemented.
;;
;; http://search.cpan.org/~exodist/Test-Simple-1.302120/lib/Test/More.pm
;; for more details on the original.
;;
;;    TODO:
;; - Add 'disable this test suite' keyword
;; - Add 'TODO this test suite' keyword
;; - Fix the issue where it sometimes shows 'expected #f got #f'
;; - On test-suite, add 'setup' and 'cleanup' keywords that take thunks

; Parameter: prefix-for-test-report
