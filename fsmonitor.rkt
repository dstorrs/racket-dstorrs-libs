;; Keep an eye on a directory or on the directory and the entire
;; subtree below it.  If anything changes, run a handler.
;;
;; dir : The directory to watch.  If #:recursive is true (the default)
;; then it will watch the subtree below the specified directory in
;; addition to the directory itself.
;;
;; handler : The function to call with there is a change.  It will
;; receive a path to the changed directory plus the value of
;; 'handler-arg' (which defaults to #f)
;;
;; handler-arg : Anything you want.  Will be passed to the handler
;; when there is a change.  Not a good idea to pass a port or a db
;; connection, since you don't know how long it will be before the
;; thing is accessed and the port/connection/whatever might have gone
;; stale in that time.  Instead, pass a function that creates the
;; port/connection/whatever.
;;
;; #:poll-delay : Number of seconds to sleep between looking for
;; change events.  Defaults to 0, which means "don't actually sleep,
;; but do suggest to Racket that this is a good time to run other
;; threads if there are any waiting."
;;
;; #:recursive : Default #t.  If true, watch the entire subtree below the specified directory
;;
;; #:pre : Function that accepts one argument, a path-string?  If
;; specified, it will be called on once for each directory that is
;; going to be watched before the actual watching starts.  This is
;; good for, e.g., adding the path to the DB or otherwise recording
;; what you're going to be watching.
