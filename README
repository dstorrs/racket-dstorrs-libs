Convenience libraries for list handling, HTML parsing, etc.

Use these by:

    In Racket code: (require "../path/to/libdir/handy/HTML-TreeBuilder.rkt")

Or, put this in your .bashrc (or other shell setup file):

    export PLTCOLLECTS=/path/to/libdir:$PLTCOLLECTS

Then in your code you can use:

    (require handy/HTML-TreeBuilder)

For me, this would be:	

    In .bashrc:     export PLTCOLLECTS=/Users/dstorrs/projects/libs/racket/handy:$PLTCOLLECTS
    In Racket code: (require handy/HTML-Element)
