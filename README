Convenience libraries for list handling, HTML parsing, etc.

Use these by:

    In Racket code:  (require "../path/to/libdir/dstorrs/HTML-TreeBuilder.rkt")

Or, put this in your .bashrc (or other shell setup file):

    export PLTCOLLECTS=/path/to/libdir:$PLTCOLLECTS

Then in your code you can use:

    (require dstorrs/HTML-TreeBuilder)

For me, the dstorrs directory is
    /Users/dstorrs/Dropbox/dstorrs/personal/scheme/dstorrs
so I would use:

    In .bashrc:      export PLTCOLLECTS=/Users/dstorrs/Dropbox/dstorrs/personal/scheme
    In Racket code:  (require dstorrs/HTML-TreeBuilder)
